vScription Transcribe Setup on XAMPP for dev
(Draft - May need some tweaking)
Last update 10NOV2021 - RG

XAMPP setup:
- Use apache and PHP8
- NEED a self signed SSL certificate
- Copy the cacerts.pem and other curl-ca-bundle.crt to apache/bin folder.
- Set DocumentRoot of apache24 to <repo-root>/transcribe

1. Create folder under php folder called sessions
2. Update php.ini with the copy in the support_files folder of repo. Update any folder references as needed (ie: logfiles, ext folders.)
3. Update https-ssl.conf file with one from repo.
4. Copy Update the api/.env.example file to api/.env and update the DB info as needed (I will provide the Authorize.net credentials once everything setup)
5. Copy the transcribe/data/parts/constants-dev.php, config-dev.php to constants.php and config.php and update the files as needed for environment
6. Copy the transcribe/data/scripts/parts/constants-dev.js to constants.js and update as needed
7. Create new DB (vtexvsi_transcribe) and import the DB structure (sqldumps/FULL_DB_STRUCTURE_10NOV2021.sql)into MariaDB (You will need to disable foreign constraints prior to importing or will fail)
8. Import base data sql  (sqldumps/FULL_DB_BASE_DATA_20OCT2021.sql)
9. Import Cities data (sqldumps/vtexvsi_transcribe_cities.sql)
10. Import the sqldumps/timezone_posix.sql (This needs to be run on the mysql database, not the vtexvsi_transcribe DB)
