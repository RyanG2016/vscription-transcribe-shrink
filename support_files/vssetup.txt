Non-XAMPP install:
Install apache 2.4 (apachelounge.com/download) to C:\apache24\

- Copy the cacerts.pem and other curl-ca-bundle.crt to apache/bin folder.
- Set DocumentRoot of apache24 to <repo-root>/transcribe

XAMPP setup:

1. Create folder under php folder called sessions
2. Update php.ini with the copy in the support_files folder of repo. Update any folder references as needed (ie: logfiles, ext folders.)
3. Update https-ssl.conf file with one from repo.
4. Copy Update the api/.env.example file to api/.env and update the DB info as needed (I will provide the Authorize.net credentials once everything setup)
5. Copy the transcribe/data/parts/constants-dev.php, config-dev.php to constants.php and config.php and update the files as needed for environment
6. Copy the transcribe/data/scripts/parts/constants-dev.js to constants.js and update as needed
7. Copy the api/config.json.example to api/config.json
8. Import Default DB
9. Import Cities data (sqldumps/vtexvsi_transcribe_cities.sql)
10. Import the sqldumps/DefaultDB/timezone_mdb_126.sql 

Start mysql
Start apache

Default login:
sysadmin@changeme.com
vScript2020

Confirm you can login

Troubleshooting Tips

After login, just returns to login screen
- Make sure you imported the timezone file

Unable to load php_curl.dll error in php_error.log
- Add PHP root folder to system path *ie: c:\php8. You will need to reboot as well

Other CURL errors
- Make sure to copy the curl-ca-bundle.crt to apache bin folder. Also, you should check the php.ini file and look for the openssl.cafile entry and this should point to this cert file as well.
