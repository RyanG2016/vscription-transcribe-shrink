1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.740
Um, and discussing overall budget issues, I guess,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.330
with the district advisory committee.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.920
So I'll just quickly walk through what's in here.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.290
So what you have right off the top on page three of two 85, uh,

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.910
just, uh, just a summary document saying this is a copy of last year's budget,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.900
uh,

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.900
remind you that we get 57.5% of our money from the province,

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.770
39.5% from property taxation,

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.220
which is not a lot that has been passed years,

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
total budget 421 million, 221,000.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.930
So that was the budget can the past.

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
So getting into the next set of information.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.490
So page five of two 85 really is the offering,

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.380
and this is an operating fund budget, by the way.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.010
So I have walked it through with you. Before that we have several funds,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.920
we have an operating fund, the capital funding, a special purpose fund.

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.450
This is the operating fund, and this is what you concentrate on, uh,

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.170
in each budget year. So again, a summary of information,

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.190
actual results from 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19,

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.870
and then the last two years of budget,

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
just to give you a comparison and the numbers are for the most part relatively

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.160
consistent year over year. Um, so again,

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.590
I don't have much in the way of comments.

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.090
This is information you have before you start moving through the document,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.740
by the way that the, a page page five,

26
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.110
that that summary is by function and this exactly what you would see in the

27
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.550
financial statements when you reviewed. Um, you know, I think, uh, Brenda,

28
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.290
I know you're flipping through the, what I'm saying.

29
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.380
I think maybe go back to page four,

30
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820
maybe went back one more,

31
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.630
one more. It's like,

32
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.340
it's very first page that's this is the one I'm really talking about in my book,

33
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.430
this five to eight and five. Anyway, this is the,

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.990
this is the page I was referring to with actions for three years budget for two

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.460
years, this is a,

36
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.030
the expenditures are described by function as opposed to objects.

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.070
And the functions are on the left hand side,

38
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.520
under expenditures codes 1000 to 9,000.

39
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.620
So it's the functions of the division and every school division reports this

40
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.810
way. So, um,

41
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.580
the next sets of information are really by object code. So in other words,

42
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.040
object code means the type of expense is so salaries, et cetera,

43
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.870
services, supplies. Uh,

44
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.930
so it's just mounds of miles of financial information. So,

45
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.280
so you have everything you ever wanted to know is in here. Um,

46
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520
it's also contained in your financial statements.

47
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.320
So that package of the one that you reviewed, uh,

48
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.460
on October 5th as a finance committee and that we approved on October 19th,

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.980
uh, is, has all of this.

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
So this is just that it's just a repeat and it does show actually prior to use.

51
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.470
So you got a sensitive Harrison.

52
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.350
So beyond that, I mean, I'm not going to start going through,

53
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.520
use a lot of numbers in here,

54
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.840
and it's just that it's a really a reference guide more than anything else to

55
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.830
say. You know,

56
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.730
if you ever got a question about what we spend on salaries in a particular

57
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
function, you can,

58
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.180
I don't think you get those sorts of questions to my knowledge in these sorts of

59
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.890
meetings, but it's there for your, for your reference.

60
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.780
So I don't have anything more to say, Mr. Chair, in that particular item. Um,

61
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.130
unless there's any questions

62
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.290
I'll open it up to you and members of the committee, if you have any questions.

63
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.880
Uh, and, uh,

64
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.630
ideally if you can raise your electronic hand over a,

65
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.490
just voice that you're interested in speaking at any point.

66
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.370
All right. So no questions on prior year's financials,

67
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.780
we've been through that a fair bit in the last year, two weeks. Yeah. Yep.

68
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.050
So the next one, Mr. Chair is against something you've seen before.

69
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.670
It's the funding gap page. This is lifted from our financial facts,

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.750
uh, document that we're currently working on now with the closing financial

71
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.583
statements.

72
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.660
So really this takes you through the amount of money that we spend on particular

73
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.370
programs, um,

74
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.170
split between revenue from the provincial government and raised through property

75
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.350
tax taxation. Um,

76
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.360
knowing that it's basically a 60,

77
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.360
40 split only programs of note are ones that don't maintain that sort of a ratio

78
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.680
60 40, because we know that 40% is a good chunk of our revenue.

79
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.730
That you're always gonna have expenditures that are attributed to property

80
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.300
taxation, but there are certain of these that are,

81
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.880
they're quite quite different. Uh,

82
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.300
student support services would lead the pack where, uh,

83
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.450
the province doesn't fund the 60 40 split clearly on this one,

84
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.000
most of the most good chunk of the money comes from the property taxation that

85
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.570
has been a constant and when a big school efficient,

86
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.020
because it's seen the need in this particular area,

87
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.020
student support services over many years that does spend beyond what many other

88
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.040
schools are here.

89
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.420
So it's just a list of items. And again,

90
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.200
this isn't been in every budget package that I've been associated with,

91
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.750
and it simply tells you, uh,

92
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.350
the areas where we perhaps fund beyond what a normal 60 40 split is.

93
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.170
Just nursing. Repeat another one.

94
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.090
That's obvious there's a few others. So again, um,

95
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.460
the one thing I did want to point out in this particular page,

96
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.970
I know it's come up in the French language.
